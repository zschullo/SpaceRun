// particle editor actually change the real properties of SKEmitterNode instances.
//
// We will need to retrieve a copy of that node by loading from our app bundle.  In order to mimic the API that
// Apple uses for sound actions, we will build a Swift exension to add a new method to the SKEmitterNode class.
//
// This is called a category in Objective-C, but is called an extension in Swift.

//Use a Swift extension to extend the String class to a property named length.
